# Welcome to **frontend-coding-problem**!

**frontend-web-app** is built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which means it is a React includes includes powerful conventions, components and a build tool chain while also offering maximum extendability.


## Local Development

---

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS ^12.x

### Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/adexphem/fe-coding-problem.git`
2. `cd fe-coding-problem`
3. `npm install` or `yarn`
6. `npm run start` or `yarn start`
### Run (dev mode)

- `npm run dev`

### Build Production

- `npm run build`

### My thought
- I had to move the json file into the Data directory and have the data synced into the state via the redux.

- The footer section of the card wasn't that clear (i.e knowing what attribute will trigger `This card is on hold` section on the card footer).

- My plan is to make use of react-datepicket package to handle the calendar part on the navigation, but cause of time, I paused work on creating the component.

- It will also be great to have the component linked up to Storybook and being able to do unit testing on them
